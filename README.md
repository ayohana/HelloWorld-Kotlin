## About

**A very basic console app that prints "Hello World!" using Kotlin.**

## Notes on Kotlin

### What is Kotlin?

* Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.
* Kotlin is an effective, modern programming language developed by JetBrains.
* **Cross-platform**
    * Knowledge of Kotlin allows developers to write mobile, server-side and desktop applications, as well as useful frameworks, and libraries.
    * A programming language for JVM (Java Virtual Machine), Android, browsers (JavaScript), and developers can compile Kotlin into native binaries, and can be run under Windows, Linux, iOS and MacOS.
* **General-purpose**
    * As a general-purpose language, it can be used in many spheres such as the financial service industry, telecommunications, embedded systems, medicine, development tools (like IntelliJ IDEA), and so on.
* Kotlin is designed as a **pragmatic language**, which means, its main purpose is to solve real-world problems rather than completing research purposes.
* It is also important that **Kotlin supports multiple programming paradigms**, such as imperative programming, object-oriented programming, generic programming, functional programming, and more. 
* Kotlin is **a tool-friendly language**, which means all popular development tools such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and Android Studio are compatible with it.

### Short History

* In July 2011, JetBrains unveiled the Kotlin Project, a new language for the Java Platform, which had been in development for a year. The name comes from Kotlin Island, near St. Petersburg, Russia. The primary goal of this project was to provide a safer and more concise alternative to Java in all the contexts where Java is currently used. 
* In 2016, the first official stable version was released (Kotlin v1.0). The developer community was already interested in using this language, especially on Android.

### Basic Literals

1. **Integer numbers**
    * Here are several examples of valid integer number literals separated by commas: `0`, `1`, `2`, `10`, `11`, `100`.
    * If an integer value contains a lot of digits, we can add **underscores** to divide the digits into blocks to make this number more readable: for example, `1_000_000` is easier to read than the same value written as `1000000`.
    
2. **Characters**
    * A single character can represent **a digit, a letter, or another symbol.**
    * To write a single character, we wrap a symbol in **single quotes** as follows: `'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'`, `'x'`, `'y'`, `'z'`, `'0'`, `'1'`, `'2'`, `'9'`.
    * A character **cannot** include two or more digits or letters, because it represents **a single symbol.**
    * The next two examples are _**incorrect**_: 'abc', '543' because these literals have too many characters.

3. **Strings**
    * Strings represent text information such as a text of an advertisement, an address of a web page, or a login to a website.
    * A string is a sequence of any individual characters.
    * To write strings we wrap characters in **double-quotes** instead of single ones.
    * Here are some valid examples: `"text"`, `"I want to learn Kotlin"`, `"123456"`, `"e-mail@gmail.com"`
    * A string can also contain only a single character, like `"A"`.
    * Do not confuse it with a character such as `'A'`, which is **not** a string.
    
#### Recap

Do not confuse these literals:

* `123` is an integer number, `"123"` is a string;
* `'A'` is a character, `"A"` is a string;
* `'1'` is a character, `1` is an integer number.
